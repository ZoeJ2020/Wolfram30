# Wolfram30

This code is for my BscHons Software Development course, with each of my exercises from the Programming 0 class.

These include implementing Wolfram's rule 30 to display the results as black/white boxes using Python terminal, and other basic exercises to test Python's conversion skills.
The exercises will be updated here as they are completed.
