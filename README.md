# Wolfram30 + miscellaneous Python code

This code is for my BscHons Software Development course at university, with exercises from my programming classes.

These include implementing Wolfram's rule 30 to display the results as black/white boxes using Python terminal, and other basic exercises to test Python's conversion skills.

## How to run

This project does not currently have a live host, so downloading it as a .zip file and running it in your terminal or using an IDE (such as VS Code) is recommended.
